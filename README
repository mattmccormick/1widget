1widget was developed by Matt McCormick and hosted at http://www.1widget.com before being shut down due to a lack of people interested in the service.

It allowed users to combine Twitter feeds with RSS feeds and display the most recent feeds on their own website.

This was my largest Python/Django project to date taking about six weeks of application developemnt time.  I was pretty new to Python/Django at that time and this project was also a chance for me to learn more about the language and framework.

I am open-sourcing it to highlight my Python development experience and in case anyone may find it helpful.
